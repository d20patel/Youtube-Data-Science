NOTE: In order for the code to run, the "top_news.json" file must be manually downloaded into the local project repository. This file is too large to be put into GitHub. In order to download the file, simply go to this link and download the file "quality_videos.tar.bz2": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wZwDIR18IHPPTiH1C0dyBbGPR-3MktI7. The tar file can then be extracted, which is where the "top_news.json" file is. For any other questions about the data, here is a link to the dataset GitHub page itself: https://github.com/avalanchesiqi/youtube-engagement.<br>

The code to clean the top_news.json file is in cleanup.py. The final Jupyter notebook shows the data before it is cleaned and after it is cleaned.
